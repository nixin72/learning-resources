## ASM (Assembly)
Assembly is a low-level programming language often synonymous with machine code. It's used for writing code at the hardware level, giving instructions directly to the CPU. Assembly code, while not binary, has everything represented as mnemonics that allows assembly programs to have a 1-to-1 representation in binary.
